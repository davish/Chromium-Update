This is a Shell Script to update the Chromium web browser.

•If on a Linux machine, wget is already installed.* 
	-Run ChromiumUpdateLinux to download the latest version of Chromium to your home directory.
	-Then place in whichever folder is used for programs.
	-When you want to update Chromium, run ChromiumUpdate again. 
	-Chromium will again be downloaded to your home directory.
		*I don't own a Linux machine to test the Chromium trunk builds themselves, so feedback would be helpful.

•If on a Mac,
	-First install wget using the wget.pkg included in the download.
	-Then, run ChromiumUpdateMac.
	-Chromium will be automatically installed to ~/Applications.
